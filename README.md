#Node + Swagger + Sequelize + Firebase + JWT
Sample application for using Firebase as authenticator, Sequelize as the ORM, Swagger for handling API routes.
1. Firebase as authenticator helps us to have a simple and secured form of login to the application. 
2. Sequelize ORM - It helps us to integrate with MySQL database with ease.
3. Swagger helps us to structure and define our routes and Request Parameter for the application, so that it does one level of validation.

This application is going to be a very simple stateless one.
